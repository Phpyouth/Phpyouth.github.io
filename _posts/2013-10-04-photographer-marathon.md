  The term minimalism is also used to
  describe a trend in design and
  architecture where in the subject is
  reduced to its necessary elements.
  Minimalist design has been highly
  influenced by Japanese traditional
  design and architecture. In addition,
  the work of De Stijl artists is a major
  source of reference for this kind of
  work.
